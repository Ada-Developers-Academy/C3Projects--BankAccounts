# Requirements for class SavingsAccount --------------------------------->

# Create a `SavingsAccount` class with a minimum of 6 specs. The class should inherit behavior from the `Account` class. It should include updated logic within the following methods:
# - `self.new(id, initial_balance)`: creates a new instance with the instance variable `id` and 'initial_balance' assigned
#   - The initial balance cannot be less than $10. If it is, this will `raise` an `ArgumentError`
# - `#withdraw(amount)`: The input amount gets taken out of the account as result of an ATM transaction. Each withdrawal 'transaction' incurs a fee of $2 that is taken out of the balance.
#   - Does not allow the account to go below the $10 minimum balance - Will output a warning message and return the original un-modified balance

# It should include the following new methods:
# - `#add_interest(rate)`: Calculate the interest on the balance and add the interest to the balance. Return the interest that was calculated and added to the balance (not the updated balance).
#   - Input rate is assumed to be a percentage (i.e. 0.25).
#   - The formula for calculating interest is `balance * rate/100`
#     - Example: If the interest rate is 0.25% and the balance is $10,000, then the interest is $25 and the new balance becomes $10,025.
