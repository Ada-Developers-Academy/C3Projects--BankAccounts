# Dinner Requirements still need to complete --------------------------->

#   - If a withdrawal causes the balance to go below $10,000, a fee of $100 is imposed and no more transactions are allowed until the balance is increased using a deposit transaction.
#   - Each transaction will be counted against the maximum number of transactions
# - `#deposit(amount)`. Returns the updated account balance.
#   - Each transaction will be counted against the maximum number of transactions
#   - Exception to the above: A deposit performed to reach or exceed the minimum balance of $10,000 is not counted as part of the 6 transactions.
# - `#add_interest(rate)`: Calculate the interest on the balance and add the interest to the balance. Return the interest that was calculated and added to the balance (not the updated balance). Note** This is the same as the `SavingsAccount` interest.
# - `#reset_transactions`: Resets the number of transactions to zero
