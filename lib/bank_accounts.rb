module BankAccounts

  # NOTE TO SELF:
  # require_relative is AMAZING -- doesn't matter what folder you're in terminal
  # as long as you reference this file correctly, these will work
  # "require" is dependant on terminal location
  require_relative './bank_accounts/account'
  require_relative './bank_accounts/savings_account'
