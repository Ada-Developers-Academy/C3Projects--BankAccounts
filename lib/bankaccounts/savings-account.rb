# Does not allow the account to go below the $10 minimum balance - Will output a warning message and return the original un-modified balance
# It should include the following new methods:
#
# #add_interest(rate): Calculate the interest on the balance and add the interest to the balance. Return the interest that was calculated and added to the balance (not the updated balance).
# Input rate is assumed to be a percentage (i.e. 0.25).
# The formula for calculating interest is balance * rate/100
# Example: If the interest rate is 0.25% and the balance is $10,000, then the interest is $25 and the new balance becomes $10,025.
